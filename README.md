# Odoo Service Manager Scripts

This repository contains two scripts to manage Odoo services running on Windows or Linux. The scripts help you:

1. Identify and stop the service running on port **8069**.
2. Disable its auto-run (auto-start on boot).
3. Restart Odoo manually when needed.

**To check what‚Äôs using port 8069 manually:**

* **Windows:**

  ```powershell
  netstat -ano | findstr :8069
